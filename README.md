# Creating Music with Artificial Intelligence Using Suno

## 📒Descripion:
This project aims to teach the creation of music using artificial intelligence, specifically with the [Suno](https://suno.com/), a generative program for realistic music. The tutorial is aimed at beginners who wish to explore musical creation through text instructions, providing a step-by-step guide to start and produce their own musical compositions.

## 🤖Technologies Used:

- Suno: An artificial intelligence tool that generates realistic music based on text prompts.
- Generative AI: AI technology that creates new and original content from specific input data.
- Alura Platform: Learning and reference source used to learn to operate Suno, especially the lessons provided by [Fabrício Carraro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SwzGdOw0HE&ab_channel=Alura).

## 🧐Creative Process:

> 1. Account Creation:
> - Set up the account and become familiar with the Suno interface.
> 2. Prompt Definition:
> - Develop an understanding of how text prompts influence musical creation.
> - Experiment with different types of text instructions to generate various atmospheres and musical styles.
> 3. Music Generation:
> - Input text prompts into Suno and generate various iterations of music.
> - Adjust prompts as necessary to refine the style and quality of the generated music.
> 4. Refinement and Editing:
> - Review the generated music and select the best compositions.
> - Make final adjustments, if necessary, using complementary audio editing software.

## 💭Reflections:
This project provides a fascinating insight into the potential of artificial intelligence in music. The ability to generate original compositions through simple text instructions democratizes musical creation, allowing even those without musical training to advance in composition. The use of Suno highlights the ongoing evolution of AI and its creative impact, encouraging continued exploration of the possibilities offered by this emerging technology.
